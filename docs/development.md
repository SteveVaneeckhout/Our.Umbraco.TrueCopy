# Development

Everything you need to run this package locally, change it, and verify the change.

The repository contains the package itself plus a complete Umbraco site to run it in. That site is a
development harness — it is never shipped, and `IsPackable` is `false` on it.

```
src/Cms/            the Umbraco host: content, templates, uSync export, dev certificate
src/TrueCopy/  the package
src/TrueCopy.Tests/  its tests
scripts/            tooling that is not part of the build
docs/               these documents
```

## Prerequisites

- **.NET 10 SDK**
- **Node 22+** (the backoffice client is TypeScript built with Vite)

Nothing else. The site uses SQLite, created on first run.

## First run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SteveVaneeckhout/Our.Umbraco.TrueCopy.git
cd Our.Umbraco.TrueCopy
dotnet run --project src/Cms
```

The first build takes a while: it restores NuGet packages and runs `npm ci` + `npm run build` for
the backoffice client, because `wwwroot/` is generated and not committed.

On first boot the site, unattended:

1. creates `src/Cms/umbraco/Data/Umbraco.sqlite.db`,
2. installs Umbraco and the admin user,
3. runs the package migration,
4. and imports every document type, data type, template and document from `src/Cms/uSync/v18`
   (`uSync:Settings:ImportOnFirstBoot`).

Then open **https://localhost:44366/umbraco** and sign in:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Email | `hello@example.com` |
| Password | `YVXVRvFlmUfwdGVWdprZWiZDKpwKiXfc` |

Those credentials, and the certificate password below, are in `src/Cms/appsettings.json` on purpose.
This is a throwaway local harness with no data worth protecting — treat every secret in this
repository as public, because it is.

Open the **Content** section, hover any document in the tree and click its **…** button:
**True Copy…** sits just below Umbraco's own *Duplicate to…*.

## The demo content

The demo content is a theme-park site, "Coaster World": 67 documents.

**The TrueCopy fixture is deliberate, and it is the only way to re-verify the rewriters.** The
*Theme Park* document type carries four properties named `tc*` — a Content Picker, a Multinode
Treepicker, a Multi URL Picker and a Block List — plus a *TrueCopy Test Block* element type and two
data types. None of them are used by any template; they exist purely to hold values that exercise
every rewriter.

**Alton Towers** and **Thorpe Park** hold those values: links to each other (both inside *United
Kingdom*, so a copy of that section repoints them), a link to **Europa-Park** in Germany
(deliberately outside it, so the "still points at the original" report is never empty), a self-link
nested inside a block, an external URL that must survive untouched, and a rich-text
`{localLink:…}`.

To see the whole feature: open the **…** menu on **United Kingdom** → *True Copy…*, choose
**Europe** as the destination, and turn **Include descendants** on. Leave descendants off and you
copy a single page, which is a real operation but a dull demonstration.

## Three optional steps

None of these are needed to run the site; each removes a specific annoyance.

### 1. Trust the development certificate

The site is served over HTTPS using a self-signed wildcard certificate for `*.127.0.0.1.nip.io`
(committed at `src/Cms/ssl/nip-io-wildcard.pfx` — without it Kestrel will not start). Your browser
will warn about it until you trust it:

```powershell
# From an elevated PowerShell prompt
./src/Cms/ssl/Install-NipIoCertificate.ps1
```

The script adds only the public certificate to `LocalMachine\Root`, never the private key, and
`-Uninstall` removes it again. Firefox needs `security.enterprise_roots.enabled` set to true to
honour the machine store. `New-NipIoCertificate.ps1` regenerates the certificate if you would rather
not use the committed one.

Why `nip.io` rather than `localhost`: it resolves any `*.127.0.0.1.nip.io` name to loopback, which
gives the harness real hostnames.

### 2. Set up the Umbraco MCP server

`.mcp.json` configures `@umbraco-cms/mcp-dev`, which lets an AI assistant read and change content
through Umbraco's management API. It needs credentials, and **a fresh clone has none** — uSync does
not export users, so the API user does not exist in your new database.

1. In the backoffice, go to **Users → API Users** and create one with access to the Content section.
2. Open its profile and copy the client id and secret.
3. `cp .env.example .env` and fill them in. `.env` is gitignored.

`scripts/verify-upgrade.mjs` reads the same file for its live checks.

### 3. Work on the backoffice client

```bash
cd src/TrueCopy/Client
npm install          # NOT --legacy-peer-deps
npm run watch        # rebuild on change
npm run build        # one-off
npm run generate-client   # regenerate src/api from the live OpenAPI document
```

Four things that will otherwise cost you an afternoon:

- **Never `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`.** Umbraco's own docs suggest it, but it skips the peer
  dependencies (`lit`, `@umbraco-ui/uui`, `rxjs`) that the TypeScript build needs for types. Without
  them you get a wall of "module has no exported member" errors.
- **Bump `version` in `Client/public/umbraco-package.json` whenever you ship a client change.**
  Umbraco uses it as the cache-busting key (`?umb__rnd=`); leave it alone and browsers keep serving
  the old bundle.
- **Static web assets are baked at build time.** After `npm run build`, the new chunks are only
  served once you rebuild and restart the site.
- **Stop the site before `dotnet build`.** A running site holds the package DLL open and the copy
  step fails: `Get-Process -Name Cms | Stop-Process -Force`.

`npm run generate-client` reads
`https://localhost:44366/umbraco/openapi/truecopy.json`, so the site has to be running. Run it
whenever a controller signature or view model changes.

## Building and testing

```bash
dotnet build Our.Umbraco.TrueCopy.slnx
dotnet test --solution Our.Umbraco.TrueCopy.slnx
dotnet format Our.Umbraco.TrueCopy.slnx --verify-no-changes
```

Three things about this that are not obvious:

- Tests are **MSTest** on **Microsoft.Testing.Platform**. The .NET 10 SDK refuses to run MTP
  projects through the old VSTest target, so `global.json` opts in with
  `"test": { "runner": "Microsoft.Testing.Platform" }`. In this mode a project is passed as
  `dotnet test --project <path>`, not positionally.
- `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` is enforced by CI, so run it before opening a pull request.
  `.gitattributes` normalises the working tree to LF; without that the check fails on line endings
  alone.
- `-p:BuildClient=false` skips the MSBuild target that shells out to npm. CI passes it everywhere and
  builds the client explicitly first, because that target only fires when the bundle is *missing* and
  will happily reuse a stale one.

## Checking an Umbraco upgrade

```bash
node scripts/verify-upgrade.mjs              # static checks plus live probes
node scripts/verify-upgrade.mjs --static-only
```

It checks that the version pins agree across the host, the package and the client, then — with the
site running — that the OpenAPI document generates, the App_Plugins bundle is served, and every
parameterless endpoint answers. [upgrading.md](upgrading.md) covers the half that needs judgement.

## Contributing

Open an issue before a large change, so we can agree the shape of it first. For anything smaller:
fork, branch, make sure `dotnet build`, `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` and `dotnet test` all pass,
and open a pull request. CI runs exactly those.

New dependencies are worth a conversation: this package deliberately depends on nothing that is not
published by Microsoft or Umbraco.
