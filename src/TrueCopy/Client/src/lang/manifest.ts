/**
 * Every language this package ships.
 *
 * Adding one is this file plus a sibling dictionary - nothing else in the package changes. Umbraco
 * loads the entry whose culture matches the editor's backoffice language (regional first, then the
 * bare language), and always loads `en` alongside it as the per-key fallback.
 *
 * Each `js` import becomes its own chunk in the Vite build, so a language nobody selects is never
 * downloaded.
